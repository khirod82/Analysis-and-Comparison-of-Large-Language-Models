### Interpretation

The analysis of 2024's large language models (LLMs) reveals key insights:

1. **Parameter-Tokens Correlation**: Larger models tend to process more tokens, impacting performance.
2. **Prediction Accuracy**: LinearRegression predicted ALScore with higher accuracy (RMSE 344.03) than RandomForestRegressor predicted tokens (RMSE 6460.98).
3. **Architecture Impact**: Different model architectures significantly influence performance scores.
4. **Training Dataset Influence**: The quality and diversity of training datasets substantially affect model performance.
5. **Performance Trade-offs**: Optimal model performance requires balancing size, data quality, and architecture design.
